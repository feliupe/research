In 2013 started the research related to video processing, tracking bull sperms in a video sample.

We tried two approachs and since we didn't got good results with the first.

The first one it's a segmentation algorithm using frame difference.

I had lack in experience in the topic of statistical learning and my orientator had never worked with video processing, so we found better to take a practical example, understand it and adapt it to our necessity.
Once understood enough, his parameters started to be changed using the experience from my research and the experience of my orientor.

Both have results. I also attached the final report, if it interests to you.
